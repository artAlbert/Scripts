# Scripts

### eaJobScraper
* A script I'd like to develop that scrapes Environics Analytics' careers page and e-mails me a list of open positions.
To limit spam, I want this script to run at the end of each day and only e-mail me the list of positions if the careers page has been changed.
If no new roles have been added then I would like the script to do nothing.
